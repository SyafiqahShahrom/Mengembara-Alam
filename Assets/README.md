# Mengembara Alam – Augmented Reality Educational Application

**Mengembara Alam** is an interactive mobile application developed to raise environmental awareness among children, with a focus on global warming. The app leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology, interactive storytelling, and educational modules to deliver an engaging and accessible learning experience.

This project was developed as part of my final-year coursework for the Bachelor of Software Engineering (Multimedia System Development), showcasing skills in full-stack multimedia software development and AR integration.

## Project Objective

The application aims to:

- Educate children about environmental issues such as global warming through interactive content.
- Offer immersive learning experiences using AR and gamification.
- Support inclusive education by providing a sensory-friendly environment suitable for children, including those with autism.
